The terrain graphics in TERRAIN.LBX aren't in the same graphics format as the rest of the MoM graphics. The format is much simpler. 

TERRAIN.LBX subfile 0 has a 192 byte header on it - I've no idea what this is for so skip it. 

Each terrain tile is then made up of 
An 8 byte header 
The image data 
A 4 byte footer 

The first byte of the header is the width - this is always 20. The second byte is the height - this is always 18. I've no idea what the remaining 6 bytes in the header or the 4 bytes in the footer are for. 

The image data is therefore always 20 * 18 = 360 bytes long, so each image including the header and footer takes up 372 bytes. Each byte of image data is an index into the standard MoM palette (see code in post about standard graphics format for this palette). There are 1,761 images.
