George McGinn (georgemcginn@yahoo.com) 12/15/99 

This file handles building info, pretty much everything but the descriptions (which are in Builddesc.lbx). 
Records start at hex 224(the NONE building), and continue until 940 (the city wall). 
Each are 52 bytes long.

1,19 -> Building name 
20 -> 00 byte 
21,22 -> first building which is required for this one to be built LO 
(match the building to the Building index below) 
23,24 -> same as above LO 
25,26 -> building (if any) this replaces LO 
27,28 -> does building confer Regular XP to units 
29,30 -> does building confer Veteran XP to units 
31,32 -> does building confer magic weapons to units
